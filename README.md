# Single_Cycle_RISC-V_Processor
A processor my partner and I created in verilog for our computer organization class. It is compatible with most of the RISC-V base ISA.
The top module can either read in VMH files or 32bit RISC-V instructions. Includes gcd.vmh (greatest common divisor) and fibonacci.vmh. Outputs are specified in top_tb.v.
